Program 1 is run by typing "python prog4_1.py ..." in the terminal where "..." is the name of a text file. It reads
each line in the text file and replaces it with the same line without spaces with each word separated by a
comma. Program 2 imports the StackMachine class. Program 2 is run by typing "python3 prog4_1.py
..." in the terminal where "..." is the name of a text file. It reads each line and checks if it is one or two words. If it
is two words it checks if the first word is push and the second word is a valid number. If it satisfies both
conditions, it converts the second word to an int or float and pushes it using the StackMachine. If it is
one word, it checks if it is pop, add, sub, mul, div, or mod. If it is, then it performs those methods using
StackMachine.
